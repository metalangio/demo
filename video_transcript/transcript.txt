0:15So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack,
0:21and all it requires of you is this:
0:24that you change your posture for two minutes.
0:28But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now
0:31do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.
0:35So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
0:37Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your ankles.
0:41Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
0:45Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
0:48I see you.
0:50So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.
0:53We're going to come back to that in a few minutes,
0:56and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit,
0:59it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.
1:02So, we're really fascinated with body language,
1:07and we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
1:11You know, we're interested in, like, you know — (Laughter) —
1:15an awkward interaction, or a smile,
1:19or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink,
1:24or maybe even something like a handshake.
1:27Narrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.
1:30This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States.
1:35Here comes the Prime Minister -- No. (Laughter) (Applause)
1:40(Laughter) (Applause)
1:42Amy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake,
1:46can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
1:48Even the BBC and The New York Times.
1:51So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior,
1:55or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists --
1:58it's language, so we think about communication.
2:01When we think about communication, we think about interactions.
2:04So what is your body language communicating to me?
2:06What's mine communicating to you?
2:08And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.
2:14So social scientists have spent a lot of time
2:17looking at the effects of our body language,
2:19or other people's body language, on judgments.
2:21And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
2:24And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes
2:28like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
2:32For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University,
2:37shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips
2:41of real physician-patient interactions,
2:44their judgments of the physician's niceness
2:47predict whether or not that physician will be sued.
2:50So it doesn't have to do so much
2:52with whether or not that physician was incompetent,
2:54but do we like that person and how they interacted?
2:57Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton
3:00has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces
3:03in just one second predict 70 percent
3:07of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes,
3:11and even, let's go digital,
3:14emoticons used well in online negotiations
3:18can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation.
3:21If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
3:24So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others,
3:27how they judge us and what the outcomes are.
3:30We tend to forget, though, the other audience
3:32that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves.
3:35We are also influenced by our nonverbals,
3:38our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
3:41So what nonverbals am I talking about?
3:44I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice,
3:47and I teach at a competitive business school,
3:50so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.
3:54I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions
3:58of power and dominance.
4:00And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
4:03Well, this is what they are.
4:05So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
4:08So you make yourself big, you stretch out,
4:11you take up space, you're basically opening up.
4:14It's about opening up.
4:15And this is true across the animal kingdom.
4:18It's not just limited to primates.
4:21And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)
4:24So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically,
4:27and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.
4:30And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us
4:33how universal and old these expressions of power are.
4:38This expression, which is known as pride,
4:40Jessica Tracy has studied.
4:42She shows that people who are born with sight
4:45and people who are congenitally blind do this
4:48when they win at a physical competition.
4:51So when they cross the finish line and they've won,
4:53it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.
4:56They do this.
4:57So the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.
4:59What do we do when we feel powerless?
5:01We do exactly the opposite.
5:03We close up. We wrap ourselves up.
5:06We make ourselves small.
5:07We don't want to bump into the person next to us.
5:09So again, both animals and humans do the same thing.
5:12And this is what happens when you put together high and low power.
5:16So what we tend to do when it comes to power
5:19is that we complement the other's nonverbals.
5:22So if someone is being really powerful with us,
5:24we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.
5:27We do the opposite of them.
5:29So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom,
5:32and what do I notice?
5:34I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.
5:42So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas,
5:44really coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room
5:48before class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.
5:51When they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
5:53They raise their hands like this.
5:55You have other people who are virtually collapsing
5:58when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.
6:00You see it on their faces and their bodies,
6:03and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny,
6:05and they go like this when they raise their hand.
6:08I notice a couple of things about this.
6:10One, you're not going to be surprised.
6:11It seems to be related to gender.
6:13So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
6:19Women feel chronically less powerful than men,
6:22so this is not surprising.
6:23But the other thing I noticed
6:25is that it also seemed to be related to the extent
6:28to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating.
6:32And this is really important in the MBA classroom,
6:35because participation counts for half the grade.
6:37So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.
6:42You get these equally qualified women and men coming in
6:45and then you get these differences in grades,
6:47and it seems to be partly attributable to participation.
6:50So I started to wonder, you know, okay,
6:53so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.
6:57Is it possible that we could get people to fake it
7:00and would it lead them to participate more?
7:02So my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,
7:06and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?
7:10Like, can you do this just for a little while
7:12and actually experience a behavioral outcome
7:15that makes you seem more powerful?
7:17So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people
7:20think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.
7:23But our question really was,
7:24do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?
7:28There's some evidence that they do.
7:31So, for example, we smile when we feel happy,
7:35but also, when we're forced to smile
7:38by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.
7:42So it goes both ways.
7:44When it comes to power, it also goes both ways.
7:48So when you feel powerful,
7:50you're more likely to do this,
7:52but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful,
7:58you are more likely to actually feel powerful.
8:02So the second question really was, you know,
8:05so we know that our minds change our bodies,
8:07but is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
8:12And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful,
8:14what am I talking about?
8:16So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
8:18and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings,
8:22and in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones.
8:25So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
8:29So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly,
8:33more assertive and more confident, more optimistic.
8:37They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance.
8:41They also tend to be able to think more abstractly.
8:45So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.
8:47There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.
8:51Physiologically, there also are differences
8:53on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone,
8:57and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
9:01So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies
9:08have high testosterone and low cortisol,
9:12and powerful and effective leaders
9:15also have high testosterone and low cortisol.
9:17So what does that mean? When you think about power,
9:20people tended to think only about testosterone,
9:22because that was about dominance.
9:24But really, power is also about how you react to stress.
9:27So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant,
9:30high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
9:33Probably not, right?
9:35You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant,
9:38but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.
9:41So we know that in primate hierarchies,
9:47if an alpha needs to take over,
9:50if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly,
9:54within a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up
9:57significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.
10:01So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape
10:04the mind, at least at the facial level,
10:06and also that role changes can shape the mind.
10:10So what happens, okay, you take a role change,
10:13what happens if you do that at a really minimal level,
10:15like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?
10:18"For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this,
10:21and it's going to make you feel more powerful."
10:23So this is what we did.
10:26We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment,
10:31and these people adopted, for two minutes,
10:34either high-power poses or low-power poses,
10:38and I'm just going to show you five of the poses,
10:40although they took on only two.
10:42So here's one.
10:45A couple more.
10:47This one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman" by the media.
10:51Here are a couple more.
10:53So you can be standing or you can be sitting.
10:55And here are the low-power poses.
10:57So you're folding up, you're making yourself small.
11:01This one is very low-power.
11:03When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
11:07So this is what happens.
11:09They come in, they spit into a vial,
11:11for two minutes, we say, "You need to do this or this."
11:14They don't look at pictures of the poses.
11:16We don't want to prime them with a concept of power.
11:19We want them to be feeling power.
11:21So two minutes they do this.
11:22We then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items,
11:25and then we give them an opportunity to gamble,
11:28and then we take another saliva sample.
11:30That's it. That's the whole experiment.
11:32So this is what we find.
11:34Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,
11:36we find that when you are in the high-power pose condition,
11:4086 percent of you will gamble.
11:42When you're in the low-power pose condition,
11:44only 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference.
11:48Here's what we find on testosterone.
11:51From their baseline when they come in,
11:53high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase,
11:56and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.
12:01So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
12:04Here's what you get on cortisol.
12:06High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease,
12:10and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.
12:14So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes
12:17that configure your brain
12:18to basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable,
12:23or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down.
12:28And we've all had the feeling, right?
12:30So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves,
12:36so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.
12:38Also, our bodies change our minds.
12:40But the next question, of course,
12:43is, can power posing for a few minutes
12:45really change your life in meaningful ways?
12:47This is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes.
12:51Where can you actually apply this?
12:53Which we cared about, of course.
12:55And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations,
13:01like social threat situations.
13:04Where are you being evaluated, either by your friends?
13:07For teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table.
13:09For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting.
13:13It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this
13:17or doing a job interview.
13:19We decided that the one that most people could relate to
13:22because most people had been through, was the job interview.
13:25So we published these findings,
13:28and the media are all over it,
13:29and they say, Okay, so this is what you do
13:32when you go in for the job interview, right?
13:34(Laughter)
13:35You know, so we were of course horrified, and said,
13:37Oh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all.
13:39For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.
13:42Again, this is not about you talking to other people.
13:44It's you talking to yourself.
13:46What do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this.
13:49You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone --
13:52or your Android, not trying to leave anyone out.
13:54You're looking at your notes,
13:56you're hunching up, making yourself small,
13:58when really what you should be doing maybe is this,
14:00like, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.
14:03So that's what we want to test. Okay?
14:05So we bring people into a lab,
14:07and they do either high- or low-power poses again,
14:10they go through a very stressful job interview.
14:13It's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
14:16They're being judged also,
14:18and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback,
14:23so they look like this.
14:25Imagine this is the person interviewing you.
14:27So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.
14:31People hate this.
14:33It's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand."
14:37So this really spikes your cortisol.
14:39So this is the job interview we put them through,
14:41because we really wanted to see what happened.
14:43We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.
14:46They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.
14:49They have no idea who's been posing in what pose,
14:52and they end up looking at these sets of tapes,
14:57and they say, "We want to hire these people,"
15:00all the high-power posers.
15:01"We don't want to hire these people.
15:03We also evaluate these people much more positively overall."
15:07But what's driving it?
15:08It's not about the content of the speech.
15:10It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
15:13Because we rate them on all these variables
15:16related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech?
15:19How good is it? What are their qualifications?
15:22No effect on those things. This is what's affected.
15:24These kinds of things.
15:26People are bringing their true selves, basically.
15:28They're bringing themselves.
15:30They bring their ideas, but as themselves,
15:32with no, you know, residue over them.
15:34So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
15:39So when I tell people about this,
15:42that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior,
15:46and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me,
15:49"It feels fake." Right?
15:50So I said, fake it till you make it.
15:52It's not me.
15:54I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.
15:57I don't want to feel like an impostor.
15:59I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here.
16:03And that really resonated with me,
16:05because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor
16:08and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.
16:11When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.
16:14I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.
16:17I was thrown from the car.
16:19And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,
16:22and I had been withdrawn from college,
16:24and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations,
16:30which was very traumatic.
16:32I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart,
16:35and I had been called gifted as a child.
16:37So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.
16:41They say, "You're not going to finish college.
16:43Just, you know, there are other things for you to do,
16:45but that's not going to work out for you."
16:47So I really struggled with this, and I have to say,
16:51having your identity taken from you, your core identity,
16:54and for me it was being smart,
16:56having that taken from you,
16:57there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.
17:00So I felt entirely powerless.
17:02I worked and worked, and I got lucky,
17:04and worked, and got lucky, and worked.
17:06Eventually I graduated from college.
17:08It took me four years longer than my peers,
17:10and I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,
17:15to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton,
17:17and I was like, I am not supposed to be here.
17:20I am an impostor.
17:22And the night before my first-year talk,
17:24and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.
17:27That's it.
17:28I was so afraid of being found out the next day
17:31that I called her and said, "I'm quitting."
17:34She was like, "You are not quitting,
17:35because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.
17:38You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.
17:41You are going to fake it.
17:42You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.
17:45You're just going to do it and do it and do it,
17:48even if you're terrified and just paralyzed
17:50and having an out-of-body experience,
17:52until you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
17:56Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'"
17:59So that's what I did.
18:00Five years in grad school,
18:01a few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern,
18:03I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,
18:05I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,
18:09"Not supposed to be here."
18:11So at the end of my first year at Harvard,
18:14a student who had not talked in class the entire semester,
18:18who I had said, "Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail,"
18:22came into my office. I really didn't know her at all.
18:25She came in totally defeated, and she said,
18:28"I'm not supposed to be here."
18:35And that was the moment for me.
18:37Because two things happened.
18:38One was that I realized,
18:40oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore.
18:43I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.
18:46And the second was, she is supposed to be here!
18:48Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
18:50So I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!
18:54And tomorrow you're going to fake it,
18:56you're going to make yourself powerful, and, you know --
18:58(Applause)
19:04And you're going to go into the classroom,
19:08and you are going to give the best comment ever."
19:10You know? And she gave the best comment ever,
19:13and people turned around and were like,
19:15oh my God, I didn't even notice her sitting there. (Laughter)
19:18She comes back to me months later,
19:20and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it,
19:23she had actually faked it till she became it.
19:25So she had changed.
19:27And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.
19:31Fake it till you become it.
19:34Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.
19:38The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.
19:40Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
19:45So, this is two minutes.
19:47Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
19:49Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation,
19:52for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator,
19:55in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.
19:58That's what you want to do.
20:00Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation.
20:03Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.
20:05Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
20:09Leave that situation feeling like,
20:11I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am.
20:14So I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing,
20:20and also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple.
20:25I don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter)
20:27Give it away. Share it with people,
20:29because the people who can use it the most
20:31are the ones with no resources and no technology
20:35and no status and no power.
20:37Give it to them because they can do it in private.
20:40They need their bodies, privacy and two minutes,
20:42and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.
20:45Thank you.
